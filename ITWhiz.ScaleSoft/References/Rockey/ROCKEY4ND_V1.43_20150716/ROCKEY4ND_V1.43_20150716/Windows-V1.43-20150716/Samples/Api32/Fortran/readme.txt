Under this directory is the sample program of Fortran Power Station:

The interface that the Fortran Power Station adopted is the Rockey4ND.obj which is generated by VC.
Pay attention to insert Rokcey4ND.obj into you project.
In addition,be sure to add advapi32.lib which is neccessary to Rockey4ND.obj 
to "Build | Setting | Link | Object/library modules" before you build your program.

It's a compiler's bug if "Intenal error" is appared in the build of release.
